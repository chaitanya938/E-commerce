# SMS Notification Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. **Customer Order Confirmation SMS/WhatsApp**
- **File**: `backend/utils/whatsappService.js` (renamed from WhatsApp to generic messaging)
- **Trigger**: When customer places an order
- **Recipient**: Customer's phone number from shipping address
- **Content**: Order confirmation with order ID, amount, payment method, and date

### 2. **Product Owner Notification SMS/WhatsApp**
- **File**: `backend/utils/ownerNotificationService.js` (newly created)
- **Trigger**: When customer places an order
- **Recipient**: Product owner's phone number (from User model)
- **Content**: New order details including product, quantity, price, customer info, and order ID

### 3. **Updated Order Creation Flow**
- **File**: `backend/routes/orders.js`
- **Changes**: 
  - Added owner notification service import
  - Updated order creation to send notifications to both customer and owner
  - Uses shipping address phone number for customer notifications
  - Populates product owner information for notifications

### 4. **Test Script**
- **File**: `backend/test-sms.js`
- **Purpose**: Test both customer and owner notifications
- **Usage**: `node test-sms.js`

## üîß Configuration Required

### Environment Variables (in `backend/.env`)
```env
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=your_twilio_account_sid
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=your_twilio_auth_token
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=+1234567890
DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE=91
```

### For WhatsApp (optional)
```env
TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER=whatsapp:+1234567890
```

## üì± How It Works

### 1. Customer Places Order
1. Customer fills checkout form with phone number
2. Order is created in database
3. **Customer receives SMS/WhatsApp** with order confirmation
4. **Product owner receives SMS/WhatsApp** with order details

### 2. Phone Number Sources
- **Customer notification**: Uses `shippingAddress.phoneNumber` (from checkout form)
- **Owner notification**: Uses `product.owner.phone` (from User model)

### 3. Message Types
- **Customer**: Order confirmation with order details
- **Owner**: New order notification with product and customer details

## üß™ Testing

### Test the Implementation
```bash
cd backend
node test-sms.js
```

### Test with Real Order
1. Place an order through the frontend
2. Check console logs for notification status
3. Verify SMS/WhatsApp delivery

## üö® Important Notes

### Phone Number Format
- System automatically adds country code if not present
- Default country code is 91 (India)
- Can be changed via `DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE` environment variable

### Twilio Configuration
- Works with both SMS and WhatsApp
- If `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` starts with `whatsapp:`, sends via WhatsApp
- Otherwise sends via SMS

### Error Handling
- Notifications are sent in try-catch blocks
- Failures don't prevent order creation
- Errors are logged to console

## üìã Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `backend/utils/ownerNotificationService.js` - Owner notifications
- `backend/test-sms.js` - Test script
- `SMS_NOTIFICATION_SETUP.md` - Setup guide
- `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

### Modified Files
- `backend/utils/whatsappService.js` - Updated for generic messaging
- `backend/routes/orders.js` - Added owner notifications
- `backend/env.example` - Added DEFAULT_COUNTRY_CODE

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Set up Twilio account** and get credentials
2. **Configure environment variables** in `.env` file
3. **Test with test script** to verify functionality
4. **Test with real order** through frontend
5. **Monitor Twilio console** for message delivery status

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Missing environment variables** - Check `.env` file
- **Invalid phone numbers** - Verify country code and format
- **Twilio authentication** - Check credentials
- **Phone verification** - Verify numbers in Twilio console (trial accounts)

### Debug Steps
1. Check console logs for error messages
2. Verify environment variables are loaded
3. Test with Twilio's test credentials
4. Check Twilio Console for message logs
